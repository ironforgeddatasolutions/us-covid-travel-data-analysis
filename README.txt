# US COVID Travel Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes U.S. travel and mobility behavior during the COVID-19 period to understand how movement patterns changed during peak disruption and subsequent recovery phases. The objective is to translate observed travel trends into insights relevant to operations, transportation planning, and risk assessment.

---

## Problem Statement
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted travel behavior across the United States. This analysis examines how travel activity shifted over time, identifies periods of reduced mobility, and highlights recovery trends as conditions evolved.

---

## Data
- Publicly available travel and mobility datasets used to measure changes in movement over time  
- Data spans multiple years and includes time-based activity records suitable for trend analysis  
- Dataset required cleaning, alignment, and normalization prior to analysis  
- User- or entity-level identifiers were anonymized, with no demographic information included  

The focus of this project is on **behavioral trends and temporal patterns**, rather than the specific data provider.

---

## Tools & Methods
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy):** data cleaning, merging, and transformation  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** identification of trends and anomalies  
- **Time-Based Analysis:** comparison of peak disruption versus recovery periods  
- **Data Visualization:** charts illustrating changes in travel behavior over time  

Key steps included:
- Standardizing time-based metrics  
- Aggregating activity levels by period  
- Comparing short-term shocks to longer-term recovery trends  

---

## Key Findings
- Travel activity declined sharply during peak COVID disruption periods  
- Recovery patterns showed gradual increases in mobility rather than immediate rebounds  
- Behavioral shifts were more pronounced during initial disruption phases  
- Long-term trends differed meaningfully from short-term fluctuations  

---

## Impact / Use Case
The insights from this analysis can support:
- Transportation and logistics planning  
- Operational forecasting under uncertainty  
- Risk assessment and contingency planning  

This type of analysis is relevant to operations, logistics, and analytics teams responsible for planning during external disruptions.

## Repository Contents
- Jupyter Notebook containing data preparation, analysis, and visualizations  
- Supporting data files (if included)  
- Generated charts and analytical outputs  

---

## Next Steps
- Expand analysis with regional or geographic breakdowns  
- Combine mobility trends with economic or operational indicators  
- Develop a dashboard to communicate trends to non-technical stakeholders
